Hypergraph stands on the shoulders of giants. These frameworks shaped the Python workflow ecosystem and directly influenced hypergraph's design.

## Hamilton

<Card title="Hamilton" icon="link" href="https://github.com/DAGWorks-Inc/hamilton">
  Pioneered function-signature-as-graph-definition for production feature engineering
</Card>

Hamilton pioneered the idea that a Python function's signature *is* the graph definition — parameter names become edges, return values flow downstream. Born at Stitch Fix in 2019 for production feature engineering, Hamilton proved that this approach works at scale. Stefan Krawczyk and Elijah ben Izzy later founded DAGWorks to develop it as an open-source project.

### Hamilton's Strengths

Hamilton's strengths run deep:

  <Card title="Hamilton UI" icon="chart-line">
    Execution telemetry, data catalogs, and artifact inspection

    `@config.when()` and `@parameterize()` keep DAGs DRY
  </Card>
  <Card title="Portability" icon="arrows-split-up-and-left">
    Define once, run in notebooks, scripts, Airflow, or Spark
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Influence on Hypergraph

Hypergraph's automatic edge inference is a direct descendant of Hamilton's core insight. Where the two diverge is in scope:

- **Hamilton** is a mature, production-tested DAG framework with deep observability
- **Hypergraph** extends the same function-as-node philosophy into cycles, conditional routing, and agentic patterns — territory that DAG frameworks don't cover by design

<Tip>
  If you need a battle-tested DAG framework with enterprise observability, choose Hamilton. If you need DAGs *and* cycles with minimal ceremony, choose Hypergraph.
</Tip>

## Pipefunc

<Card title="Pipefunc" icon="link" href="https://github.com/pipefunc/pipefunc">
  Clean API design for scientific computing pipelines
</Card>

Pipefunc, created by Bas Nijholt in 2023, has been a major influence on hypergraph's API. The `@pipefunc` decorator with `output_name`, the `Pipeline` that auto-connects functions by matching names, `.map()` for parallel fan-out, the rename API for adapting functions to different contexts, nested pipelines for composition, and build-time type validation — hypergraph's versions of all of these trace back to pipefunc's clean, well-thought-out design.

### Pipefunc's Strengths

Pipefunc is particularly strong in scientific computing:

  <Card title="MapSpec" icon="grid">
    N-dimensional parameter sweeps with fine-grained parallelization
  </Card>
  <Card title="HPC Integration" icon="server">
    First-class SLURM integration for cluster computing
  </Card>
  <Card title="Lightweight" icon="gauge-high">
    ~15 microseconds overhead per function
  </Card>
  <Card title="Think Singular" icon="1">
    Write for one, scale with map pattern
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Influence on Hypergraph

The "think singular, scale with map" pattern is something pipefunc got right early on. Hypergraph adopted this philosophy and extended it into a different domain:

- **Pipefunc** excels at scaling pure computations across parameter spaces
- **Hypergraph** adds runtime conditional routing, cycles, and human-in-the-loop patterns for interactive and agentic workflows

<Note>
  Pipefunc's API design directly influenced hypergraph's decorator syntax, rename API, and composition patterns.

## Kedro

<Card title="Kedro" icon="link" href="https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro">
  Software engineering discipline for data science workflows
</Card>

Kedro brought software engineering discipline to data science. Created at QuantumBlack (McKinsey's AI arm) and open-sourced in 2019, it reached 1.0 in 2024 and graduated as a Linux Foundation project. Kedro showed that data pipelines deserve the same rigor as production software: standardized project structure, a Data Catalog that abstracts I/O across storage backends, environment-specific configuration, and modular pipelines that teams can share and compose.

### Kedro's Strengths

Kedro's influence on the broader ecosystem is hard to overstate:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Project Structure" icon="folder-tree">
    Standardized directory layouts and conventions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data Catalog" icon="database">
    Abstract I/O across storage backends
  </Card>
  <Card title="Configuration" icon="gear">
    Environment-specific config management
  </Card>
  <Card title="Governance" icon="shield">
    Reproducibility and compliance for teams
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

For teams that need reproducibility and governance across complex data workflows, Kedro remains one of the most mature choices available.

### Kedro-Viz Influence

Hypergraph draws specific inspiration from **Kedro-Viz**, Kedro's interactive visualization tool:

- Collapsible namespace hierarchies
- Tag-based filtering
- Ability to make large pipelines (hundreds of nodes) navigable at a glance

<Tip>
  Kedro-Viz set the standard for what graph visualization should look like. Hypergraph's visualization layer aspires to that same level of clarity, adapted for graphs that include cycles and runtime state transitions.
</Tip>

### Philosophy Difference

Where Kedro and hypergraph differ is in philosophy:

- **Kedro** provides structure and conventions for the full project lifecycle (data management, configuration, deployment)
- **Hypergraph** focuses narrowly on the graph itself — pure functions, automatic wiring, minimal ceremony — and leaves project structure to the user

## Summary

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Hamilton" icon="diagram-project">
    Automatic edge inference from function signatures
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pipefunc" icon="code">
    Clean API design and "think singular, scale with map"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Kedro" icon="eye">
    Visualization standards and hierarchical composition
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Hypergraph takes the best ideas from each — Hamilton's edge inference, Pipefunc's API clarity, and Kedro's visualization standards — and extends them to support the full spectrum of modern AI workflows: DAGs, cycles, conditional routing, and human-in-the-loop interactions.
